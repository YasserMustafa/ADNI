\part{Using HMMs to predict disease progression}

\paragraph{Transfer Learning/Manifolds}

Due to difference in protocols between MRI images from ADNI1 and
ADNIGO/ADNI2 we are unable to combine information from all three
cohorts to learn a unified classifier/model. 

A recent work explores this theme by learning a shared manifold using
data from all 3 protocols. Not only does this utilize all data, but it
simultaneously projects the data onto a more manageable lower
dimension.

\paragraph{Missing data}

This problem manifests in two ways; particular patients missing
certain visits, and the more severe problem of every patient not
having data from every modality. This severely restricts any
approaches that attempt to use multi-modal approaches for
classification.

A recent work attempts to solve the problem by learning separate
classifiers on groups of data (e.g. MRI+PET, MRI+CSF, etc.) and
combining information from separate classifiers by using ensemble
approaches.

\paragraph{Unsupervised Feature Learning}

We currently rely on features that are highly pre-processed. For
instance, the only PET data available to us is the mean tracer
retention in 5 ROIs in the brain. These ROIs are selected mainly on
the basis of positive correlation with clinical disease
label. However, such a highly processed dataset maybe obfuscating
useful information that can be mined effectively.

\paragraph{Noisy Labels/Lack of Gold Standard}

Often, the clinical labels assigned to patients (NL/MCI/AD) are
noisy/incorrect. Furthermore, labeling patients as
MCI-converters/MCI-non-converters is problematic due to the incomplete
information available to us. 

The only method of obtaining gold standard diagnosis for patients
(currently) is through post-mortem analysis of brain tissue, and this
information is currently only available for a very small number of
patients.

\paragraph{Amyloid-retention in brain}

Amyloid retention in PET-scans is a recently popularized modality that
provides us information about the level of amyloid deposits in the
brain. However, there is very little consensus about the effects of
amyloid on the onset of AD/conversion likelihood from MCI.

\paragraph{Evaluating HMMs}

Common approaches to evaluating similar unsupervised learning
approaches in the literature (besides those we already explored) are
to threshold the unsupervised models at some probability/state and
evaluate it as a discriminative classifier. Another common approach is
to use the Pearson correlation coeffecient by examining correlation
with clinical scores such as the MMSE.

\paragraph{Non-gaussian nature of clinical data}

Clinical scores (MMSE/CDR/ADAS\-Cog) are scored in a
binary manner (correct/incorrect), with the scores then being
aggregated over several questions. A Gaussian emission model fails in
such situations, and a Bernoulli distribution might be better suited.
